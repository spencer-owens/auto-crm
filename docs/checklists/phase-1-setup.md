# Phase 1: Project Setup

This phase establishes the foundation of the project, including installing dependencies, configuring the environment, and creating the initial folder structure.

1. [x] FRONTEND: Initialize a new Vite + React project.  
   - Created with TypeScript template
   - Set up in src/frontend directory following best practices
2. [x] FRONTEND: Install Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, and Radix UI. Configure Tailwind (globals.css) for a desktop-first layout.  
   - Installed and configured Tailwind CSS with proper configuration
   - Added Shadcn UI theme variables and utilities
   - Set up Radix UI primitives and animations
   - Created globals.css with theme configuration
3. [x] FRONTEND: Set up Zustand for global state management (minimal store for now).  
   - Created useAppStore with theme management
   - Implemented ThemeProvider component
   - Added theme toggle functionality
4. [x] BACKEND: Initialize a FastAPI project structure.  
   - Created backend directory structure (api, services, models)
   - Set up initial FastAPI application
5. [x] BACKEND: Create main.py with a simple FastAPI "Hello World" endpoint to confirm the server runs.  
   - Created main.py with root endpoint
   - Added CORS middleware for frontend integration
6. [x] BACKEND: Add requirements.txt or pyproject.toml for backend dependencies (FastAPI, Supabase, etc.).  
   - Added requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies
   - Included FastAPI, Supabase, and authentication packages
7. [x] BOTH: Organize the folder structure following codebase-best-practices.md.  
   - Created recommended directory structure
   - Set up components, pages, hooks, and styles directories
8. [x] BOTH: Add README.md detailing how to run frontend and backend.  
   - Added comprehensive setup instructions
   - Included environment variables setup
   - Added project structure and features overview
9. [x] BOTH: Set up environment variables (.env) as described in tech-stack-rules.md for local dev (API keys, DB URL).  
   - Created frontend .env with Supabase configuration
   - Created backend .env with database and service keys
10. [x] BOTH: Verify everything starts together:  
    - [x] Run Vite dev server (frontend) - Running on http://localhost:5173
    - [x] Run FastAPI (backend) - Running on http://localhost:8000

✅ Phase 1 Setup Complete! Ready to proceed to Phase 2: Auth and Roles.
