# Phase 1: Project Setup

This phase establishes the foundation of the project, including installing dependencies, configuring the environment, and creating the initial folder structure.

1. [ ] FRONTEND: Initialize a new Vite + React project.  
2. [ ] FRONTEND: Install Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, and Radix UI. Configure Tailwind (globals.css) for a desktop-first layout.  
3. [ ] FRONTEND: Set up Zustand for global state management (minimal store for now).  
4. [ ] BACKEND: Initialize a FastAPI project structure.  
5. [ ] BACKEND: Create main.py with a simple FastAPI “Hello World” endpoint to confirm the server runs.  
6. [ ] BACKEND: Add requirements.txt or pyproject.toml for backend dependencies (FastAPI, Supabase, etc.).  
7. [ ] BOTH: Organize the folder structure following codebase-best-practices.md.  
8. [ ] BOTH: Add README.md detailing how to run frontend and backend.  
9. [ ] BOTH: Set up environment variables (.env) as described in tech-stack-rules.md for local dev (API keys, DB URL).  
10. [ ] BOTH: Verify everything starts together:  
    - Run Vite dev server (frontend).  
    - Run FastAPI (backend).
