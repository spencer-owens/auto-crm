# Phase 2: User Authentication & Role Management

Implement user registration, login, and role distinctions (customers, agents, admins) following Supabase Auth and your backend logic.

1. [x] FRONTEND: Create a Signup page with form fields for email/password/full name.  
   - Created SignupPage component with form validation
   - Added error handling and loading states
   - Implemented responsive design with Tailwind CSS
2. [x] FRONTEND: Integrate Supabase Auth in a custom hook (e.g., useAuthStore) for registration and login.  
   - Created useAuthStore with Zustand
   - Implemented signUp, signIn, and signOut functions
   - Added error handling and loading states
   - Set up proper TypeScript types for User and AuthState
3. [x] FRONTEND: Build a Login page that validates inputs and logs the user in via Supabase.  
   - Created LoginPage component with form validation
   - Added error handling and loading states
   - Implemented responsive design with Tailwind CSS
4. [x] FRONTEND: Add role-based UI logic (e.g., hide admin links unless user.role === "admin").  
   - Created ProtectedRoute component for role-based access control
   - Implemented route protection with React Router
   - Added role-specific route guards (e.g., admin panel)
   - Set up automatic redirects for unauthorized access
5. [~] BACKEND: Configure Supabase row-level security (RLS) for user data, ensuring customers can only see their own records.  
   - ✅ Created SQL policies file with RLS rules
   - ⏳ Database tables need to be created first (will be done in Phase 3)
   - ⏳ RLS policies to be implemented after table creation
6. [x] BACKEND: Extend main.py or a dedicated auth.py with endpoints to fetch or update user profiles, including roles.  
   - Created auth.py with FastAPI routes for profile management
   - Implemented user profile update endpoint
   - Added role retrieval endpoint
   - Set up proper request/response models with Pydantic
7. [x] BACKEND: Validate token or JWT in protected routes (tickets, admin pages) to enforce role checks.  
   - Implemented JWT validation middleware
   - Created get_current_user dependency
   - Added proper error handling for invalid tokens
   - Set up role-based access control in auth service

✅ Phase 2 Core Authentication Complete! 
⏳ Note: RLS implementation pending database setup in Phase 3.
