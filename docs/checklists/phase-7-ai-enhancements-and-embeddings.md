# Phase 7: Advanced AI Features & Embeddings

Leverage Supabase pgvector and LangChain to power semantic search, text embeddings, or more advanced automation.

1. [ ] BACKEND: Set up pgvector extension in Supabase if not already enabled.  
2. [ ] BACKEND: Extend ai_service.py for embedding knowledge base articles or ticket data into vector form.  
3. [ ] BACKEND: Build endpoints to perform semantic search (e.g., approximate nearest-neighbor queries).  
4. [ ] BACKEND: Caching & optimization: Store frequently accessed embedding results or queries to reduce compute.  
5. [ ] FRONTEND: Integrate a semantic search bar in KnowledgeBase to show relevant articles.  
6. [ ] FRONTEND: Provide UI feedback if the AI returns no matching results.  
7. [ ] FRONTEND: Possibly highlight matching text or provide a snippet to show how the content is relevant.
