# Phase 8: Final Polish & Deployment

Wrap up remaining tasks, refine UI/UX, and deploy to your chosen platform (AWS Amplify, Railway, or others).

1. [ ] FRONTEND: Conduct a final UI pass, ensuring alignment with theme-rules.md (minimalist, consistent spacing).  
2. [ ] FRONTEND: Review accessibility (UI elements, alt text, ARIA labels).  
3. [ ] FRONTEND: Optimize bundle size; consider code splitting or lazy loading as necessary.  
4. [ ] BACKEND: Ensure migrations are finalized and properly documented.  
5. [ ] BACKEND: Run final tests on endpoints (auth, tickets, AI) for stability.  
6. [ ] BACKEND: Decide on hosting strategy for the FastAPI microservice (e.g., Railway).  
7. [ ] BOTH: Integrate environment variables for production (Supabase keys, domain settings).  
8. [ ] BOTH: Perform end-to-end testing: create tickets, run AI queries, ensure role-based access.  
9. [ ] BOTH: Deploy the frontend (AWS Amplify or your choice) and backend (Railway or your choice).  
10. [ ] BOTH: Validate logs, confirm real-time features, ensure minimal downtime.
