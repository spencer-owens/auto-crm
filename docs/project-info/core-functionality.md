# Core Functionality Requirements

This document outlines the essential features and capabilities required for AutoCRM.

## 1. User Authentication & Role Management

- Allow users to sign up or log in via Supabase Auth.  
- Distinguish between "customer," "agent," and "admin" roles in the user record or a separate role-mapping structure.  
- Provide secure, role-based access to resources (e.g., only admins can view analytics, only agents can view the agent dashboard).

## 2. Ticket Creation & Updating

- Customers can create new tickets with a subject, description, and optional file attachments.  
- Agents can update statuses, add internal notes, or reply to the customer.  
- Admins can override ticket assignments or escalate tickets when necessary.

## 3. Ticket Queue & Filtering

- Agents see a list of tickets assigned to them or their team.  
- Provide filters by status, priority, date ranges, tags, etc.  
- Support bulk operations (e.g., update multiple tickets to "pending" at once).

## 4. Messages & Collaboration

- Each ticket has a log of messages showing the conversation between customer and agent.  
- Agents can leave internal notes not visible to the customer.  
- Provide macros or templates for quick responses.

## 5. Analytics & Reporting

- Admins can view metrics like ticket volume, agent performance/ratings, response times, and resolution rate.  
- Possibly store or compute daily/weekly aggregates for quicker reporting.

## 6. Self-Service Tools

- Public knowledge base accessible without login.  
- AI chatbots integrated via a separate or embedded UI.  
- Prompt user to search articles before creating a ticket.

## 7. Feedback & Rating System

- Once a ticket is resolved, the customer can rate the help received.  
- Agents and admins can view/report on these ratings.

## 8. Administration & Configuration

- Admin panel for adjusting system-wide settings like routing rules, SLAs, and email templates.  
- Manage teams, user permissions, coverage schedules, and skill sets.
