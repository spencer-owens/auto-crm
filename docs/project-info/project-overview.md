# Project Overview

# AutoCRM: AI-powered Customer Relationship Management

# Background

Customer Relationship Management (CRM) applications, like Zendesk, are central to many businesses. They help support and sales teams manage diverse customer interactions while integrating with other essential tools.

CRMs often direct users to FAQs and help articles before allowing them to submit a ticket. However, many issues still require manual support, making CRMs one of the biggest sources of human labor.

AutoCRM leverages generative AI to minimize this workload and enhance the customer experience. By integrating existing help resources with the capabilities of LLMs, AutoCRM delivers an interactive support and sales experience with minimal human involvement. While some tickets may still require manual handling, the threshold is significantly raised, improving operational efficiency and boosting profitability.
