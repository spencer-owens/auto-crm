# User Flow

This document outlines a high-level user journey for each user type (Unauthenticated Visitors, Customers, Agents, and Admins), describing how they progress through different parts of the application referenced in the Project Map. The flow connects features from:
- [Project Overview](./project-overview.md)  
- [User Stories](./user-stories.md)  
- [Project Map](./project-map.md)

These journeys will guide how we build our project architecture and user interface elements.

## 1. Unauthenticated Visitors

1. **Landing/Home Page**  
   - The visitor arrives at the landing page.  
   - They can see marketing information about the platform, use top-level navigation to explore services, and find highlights of the knowledge base or AI-powered tools.  
   - (References: "Landing/Home Page" from Project Map → Unauthenticated Visitors #1, "Explore Services & Features" from User Stories → Unauthenticated Users #2)

2. **Explore Public Knowledge Base**  
   - Before creating an account, the visitor may choose to browse publicly available help articles or FAQs for quick solutions.  
   - (References: "Public Knowledge Base" from Project Map → Unauthenticated Visitors #2, "Access Public Knowledge Base" from User Stories → Unauthenticated Users #1)

3. **Sign Up or Contact**  
   - If they need more personalized support or wish to become a customer, the visitor proceeds to sign up or use a contact form for inquiries.  
   - (References: "Contact or Sign-Up Page" from Project Map → Unauthenticated Visitors #3, "Initiate Sign-Up or Contact" from User Stories → Unauthenticated Users #3)

## 2. Customers

1. **Secure Login**  
   - A user who has registered logs in through the portal.  
   - Once authenticated, they are taken to their main dashboard.  
   - (References: "Secure Login" from Project Map → Customers #1, "Secure Login" from Project Overview → Customer Portal)

2. **Dashboard / My Tickets**  
   - Customers view their active and past tickets, with summary information, statuses, and a snapshot of conversation history.  
   - (References: "Dashboard / My Tickets" from Project Map → Customers #2, "View & Track Tickets" from User Stories → Customers #1)

3. **Ticket Management**  
   - If a customer needs help, they click "Create a Ticket" to fill out all relevant details. They can attach files and add notes to open tickets.  
   - They may also explore AI chatbots or knowledge base articles if they prefer a self-service approach before creating a ticket.  
   - (References: "Ticket Management" from Project Map → Customers #3, "Create & Update Tickets" + "Use Self-Service Tools" from User Stories → Customers #2, #3)

4. **Feedback & Rating**  
   - Once a ticket is resolved, the customer is prompted to provide feedback or a rating. This may influence future improvements in support quality.  
   - (References: "Feedback & Rating" from Project Map → Customers #5, "Rate Support Experience" from User Stories → Customers #4)

## 3. Agents

1. **Agent Login / Dashboard**  
   - Agents log in to a specialized dashboard showing tickets assigned to them, real-time updates, and performance metrics.  
   - (References: "Agent Login / Dashboard" from Project Map → Agents #1, "Manage Ticket Queue" from User Stories → Agents #1)

2. **Ticket Queue & Filters**  
   - Agents see the list of incoming and active tickets. They apply filters or sorting options to organize by priority, status, or customer. They can also perform bulk operations for efficiency.  
   - (References: "Ticket Queue & Filters" from Project Map → Agents #2, "Queue Management" from Project Overview)

3. **Ticket Details / Collaboration**  
   - Selecting a ticket opens a detailed page. Agents interact with customers (e.g., reply via rich text) and can add internal notes visible only to other agents.  
   - Agents may also escalate, mention specific teammates, or close/resolve the ticket.  
   - (References: "Ticket Details / Collaboration" from Project Map → Agents #3, "Respond & Resolve Tickets" + "Use Collaboration Tools" from User Stories → Agents #2, #3)

4. **Agent Performance**  
   - Agents regularly visit their performance page to track metrics like total tickets resolved and average response time.  
   - (References: "Agent Performance" from Project Map → Agents #4, "Track Personal Performance" from User Stories → Agents #4)

## 4. Admins

1. **Admin Panel**  
   - Admins sign in (often with elevated privileges) and access the Admin Panel, the central hub for configuring the system at a high level.  
   - (References: "Admin Panel" from Project Map → Admins #1)

2. **Team & Role Management**  
   - Admins create or modify agent accounts, assign them to relevant teams, and set roles/permissions.  
   - (References: "Team & Role Management" from Project Map → Admins #2, "Manage Teams & Roles" from User Stories → Admins #1)

3. **Routing & Assignment Settings**  
   - Admins define how new tickets should be routed—perhaps by priority or based on specialized agent skills.  
   - (References: "Routing & Assignment Settings" from Project Map → Admins #3, "Configure Routing Rules" from User Stories → Admins #2)

4. **Analytics & Reporting**  
   - Admins monitor real-time dashboards displaying system indicators (ticket queue lengths, agent performance, customer satisfaction rates).  
   - (References: "Analytics & Reporting" from Project Map → Admins #4, "View System-Wide Analytics" from User Stories → Admins #3)

5. **System Configuration**  
   - Admins adjust email templates, set service-level agreements, and create integrations with external tools.  
   - (References: "System Configuration" from Project Map → Admins #5, "Configure Platform Settings" from User Stories → Admins #4)

## Additional Flow Considerations

1. **API & Webhooks (Integration Layer)**  
   - Integrated third-party apps can listen for ticket updates or push data into the system.  
   - (References: "API & Webhooks" from Project Map → Additional Sections & Links, "API-First Design" from Project Overview)

2. **Notifications & Multichannel Support**  
   - Alerts and messaging can occur through various channels (email, in-app notifications, SMS, etc.).  
   - (References: "Notifications & Multichannel Support" from Project Map → Additional Sections & Links, "Multi-Channel Support" from Project Overview)

3. **Security & Authentication**  
   - Every login flow ensures role-based or user-based access is properly enforced, so customers, agents, and admins see only what they're authorized to see.

## Summary

By mapping out each user type's journey — Unauthenticated Visitors, Customers, Agents, and Admins — we encapsulate how each segment navigates through the system. This flow details the major features from initial contact to deep functionality (like ticket management, analytics, and collaboration). It will serve as a blueprint for our architecture and help structure UI/UX development around clear user goals and interactions.
